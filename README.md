# iris-flower-classification-webapp


This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Key Steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loaded the Iris dataset, examined its structure, and checked for missing values and duplicates.
2. **Data Visualization:** Created histograms to visualize the distribution of sepal and petal measurements.
3. **Data Preprocessing:**  Encoded the 'Species' column using Label Encoding.
4. **Model Training:** Trained a Logistic Regression model on the dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's accuracy using the test data.
6. **Model Saving:** Saved the trained model using pickle for future use.


## Usage:

The project includes a trained Logistic Regression model that can be used to predict the species of an iris flower given its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The saved model can be loaded and used for predictions.
